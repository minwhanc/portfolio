# Critique by Design
_**Original data visualization**_<br/>
For the design critique assignment, I chose this chart "_Acres burned by wildfires in West Coast states_" from an article titled "_These charts show how wildfires are getting larger, more severe in the U.S._" published by CNBC on September 18, 2020. I chose this particular data visualization because not only does the graphic already have some excellent features, but it also has some places for improvement so that, if fixed, the chart could deliver more information to its audience efficiently.

_**Initial sketch**_<br/>
Before moving any forward, I first went on to the cited source (_National Interagency Fire Center_) to ensure that I would have the dataset available for a redesign. When I managed to collect all the data I would need for the redesign, I then started to wireframe what I had in mind using Infogram. Through this wireframing process, I wanted to see if the graphic would provide information on trends--that are not displayed rather clearly in the original visualization--when structured differently. Instead of having three separate bar charts, I put them in one stacked bar chart (as shown below). And indeed, the new graphic presents an increasing trend of wildfire in the west coast states overall, a trend that was not distinctly shown in the original charts.

_**Test**_<br/>
I conducted a test for my sketch to two people from very different fields of study (one studies chemical engineering and the other studies vocal performance) to get observations from more diverse perspectives. First, I showed the original chart without showing the title, and I received similar answers from both testees. They both initially thought the original chart compares recent wildfire history between the three states. And one of them didn't receive the message that the wildfire is getting more severe overall. I then showed my sketch to see if it delivers the aspect of the message that was missing. And both agreed that it does. I received an interesting suggestion from my testees that I did not apply to my redesign, but were definitely noteworthy. Instead of including cases from only three states and portray them in a bar graph, why not include those from all western states and show it in a line graph. It would definitely be more simplified and give its main point more directly, but I ended up not taking the advice as I was worried it may distort the chart's original content.<br/>

_**Final data visualization**_<br/>
For this redesign, I used a stacked bar chart instead of separate bar graphs to keep the weight on the drastic increase of wildfire in California this year and, at the same time, show the increment of wildfire size that has happened gradually over the years. Since I combined three separate charts into one, I had to distinguish different states by color. I wanted to pick colors that seemed somehow relevant to each of those states, so I created a color palette from their state flags and made a careful selection to make the color scheme distinct to the audience with red-green color blindness; for example, rather than choosing _Spanish Viridian_ (green)--the most dominant color in the state flag of Washington--for Washington, I used _Deep Lemon_ (yellow) considering that I had used _Wine Red_ (red) for California. To put more emphasis on this year's data (2020 YTD), I used tinted colors for data from 2002 to 2019 so that the color for 2020 YTD stands out with more vibrancy.
