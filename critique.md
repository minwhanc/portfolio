# Critique by Design
_**Original data visualization**_<br/>
For the design critique assignment, I chose this chart "_Acres burned by wildfires in West Coast states_" from an article titled "_These charts show how wildfires are getting larger, more severe in the U.S._" published by CNBC on September 18, 2020. I chose this particular data visualization because not only does the graphic already have some excellent features, but it also has some places for improvement so that, if fixed, the chart could deliver more information to its audience efficiently.
