# Critique by Design
_**Original data visualization**_<br/>
For the design critique assignment, I chose this chart "_Acres burned by wildfires in West Coast states_" from an article titled "_These charts show how wildfires are getting larger, more severe in the U.S._" published by CNBC on September 18, 2020. I chose this particular data visualization because not only does the graphic already have some excellent features, but it also has some places for improvement so that, if fixed, the chart could deliver more information to its audience efficiently.

Before moving any forward, I first went on to the cited source (_National Interagency Fire Center_) to ensure that I would have the dataset available for a redesign. When I managed to collect all the data I would need for the redesign, I then started to wireframe what I had in mind using Infogram. Through this wireframing process, I wanted to see if the graphic would provide information on trends--that are not displayed rather clearly in the original visualization--when structured differently. Instead of having three separate bar charts, I put them in one stacked bar chart (as shown below). And indeed, the new graphic presents an increasing trend of wildfire in the west coast states overall, a trend that was not distinctly shown in the original charts.
