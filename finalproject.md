# Final Project
## Part I
_**Outline**_<br/>
With numerous competitors entering the SVoD market, it has been more critical than ever to increase their market share by satisfying their consumers' needs under the fast-changing market trends. Though, despite its continuously rising competition, the marketplace accelerates enough so that the consumers are more likely to subscribe to multiple services as more people prefer watching a movie at home than at the theatre. However, at the same time, consumers are starting to crave newer and more different experiences that satisfy them in a more time-efficient manner. They are seeking content with shorter lengths. And furthermore, user-generated content is getting an increasing level of popularity among the consumers. Thus, SVoD companies started to focus on getting more exclusive content on their platform and producing their own original series or shows. Based on the consumers' changing behavior and growing in different tastes, the project suggests two key factors in the companies' anticipated call-to-action: Reduction and Globalization. Consumers' tendency to prefer shorter videos is one thing, but there is also an increasing trend in using mobile devices like smartphones or tablets more than other media. With that in mind, it makes shorter videos more desirable in this case, as they not only don't require long hours to watch but also are more compatible with devices like smartphones or tablets. In recent years, Netflix has managed to produce a larger share of top-rated original productions. Yes, they invest billions of dollars in them, but also they managed to expand their productions more globally. Many Netflix Originals such as Dark(Germany), Kingdom(South Korea), or Money Heist(Spain), have brought enormous success to the company. Globalization doesn't just apply to productions. The accelerating SVoD market is not a phenomenon that only happens in the United States, but rather it is a global trend. Hence, it would be a crucial and inevitable decision for companies to expand their service to the worldwide market.<br/>

_**Data**_<br/>
Data have been collected from multiple data sources as listed and linked below; all the datasets are publicly-accessible. Within our sources, some of the data are in table formats, and some are visualized. However, if visualized, all the data points are marked with values so that the data can be collected. There are two approaches that this project plans on taking to use the data: redesign or recreate. For data that has already been visualized, the project will redesign the visualization using the skill and technique learned throughout this course so that the chart can be more suitable for the project's story. On the other hand, there are some data that has to be created from scratch. For those data, the project aims to create a visualization using the most appropriate chart type and design it to illustrate its part of the story in a most efficient manner.<br/>

_**Methods and Media**_<br/>
For the project, _Shorthand_ will be used to build a story using its data. Thus, the next step for this project would be to create a storyboard using _Shorthand_. Furthermore, as the project will use _Tableau_ for all graphic visualizations that will be presented in the storyboard, visualizing the collected data with _Tableau_ would also be included in our next step of this project.

_**Wireframes and Storyboards**_<br/>
Before moving on to wireframing my sketches, I got some valuable feedback from my peers in class and applied them to my work. For example, for my pie charts sketch that tried to illustrate trends shifting from theater to SVoD, one of my peers suggested perhaps it may be better to show changing trends side-by-side with more time instance, if possible. The original dataset included three instances of data (Nov. 2018, Mar. 2020 and Jun. 2020. In my sketch, I excluded Mar. 2020 one out to create two pie charts, but after the feedback, I decided to put it back into my visualization and create a proportional stacked bar chart instead. Also, another great notion allowed me to see what I missed when drawing my sketches. For my sketch showing how daily time spent with different media devices change over the years, the choice of my chart (stacked bar chart)  did not seem to deliver its message so clearly. The original purpose of the visualization was to reduce the running time of content to make it more compatible to watch on mobile devices. However, with the overall chart showing an increase in viewing time, the claim seemed somewhat unsupported. Therefore, I decided to switch it to a proportional bar chart to align it with the chart's purpose.<br/>
