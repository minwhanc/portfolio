# Visualizing Government Debt
_**Working with web-based visualization tools and data**_<br/>
The following visualization is a **bar chart** generated using web-based visualization tools and data from the OECD. It shows the total debt-to-GDP ratio of government debt for several OECD countries in 2018.

_**Working with Flourish**_<br/>
Both visualizations, shown below, are generated with the same dataset from the OECD but using Flourish, a web-based data visualization platform. They both illustrate debt-to-GDP ratios of government debt from 1995 to 2019 (or latest available) for several OECD countries; the first graphic used a **grid of line charts**, whereas the second graphic used a **heatmap**.

_**Note**_<br/>
On this page, three different visualization methods portray the gross (general government) debt of OECD countries as a percentage of GDP. However, each of these techniques faces its own limitations in representing data thoroughly and efficiently. The dataset itself includes multiple variables, but in these charts, we are interested in incorporating two continuous variables, debt-to-GDP ratios (value) and years (time), under one categorical variable, countries (category). The *bar chart* faces some difficulties in including all three variables in one chart as our categorical variable contains many categories within it; it is rather tricky and inefficient to show values of different categories over time with a bar chart. On the other hand, a *grid of line charts* manages to include all three variables, but it does so by having individual mini-charts for each of the countries in the categorical variable, making it harder to conduct side-to-side comparisons of different trends in the data. Therefore, to remedy those drawbacks, we used a *heatmap* to visualize debt-to-GDP ratios of different countries over the years. Not only it includes all the desired variables, but also it represents them in one map to make it more convenient to compare the trends of different categories in the chart.
