# Zane Cho's portfolio (minwhanc)
This is a data visualization portfolio created by Zane Cho for 94-870 A1 Telling Stories with Data, Fall 2020.

# About me
Hello, my name is Minwhan "Zane" Cho, and I am referred to by 'he/him' pronouns. I have completed my bachelor's degree in Economics and Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University, and I am currently continuing my studies at the same school as a Master of Entertainment Industry Management (MEIM) First-Year student.

# What I hope to learn
I have had some classroom data visualization experiences in my undergraduate years, where my learnings were more focused on building technical skills to draw statistical graphics via specifically, R. From this course, I am interested in exploring more various ways to construct visualizations and getting in-depth learning of how to build graphic representations that would better communicate with my audience. As a MEIM student, I plan to incorporate my economics and statistics background with my entertainment industry management studies so that, once I graduate, I could work for the data/marketing side of the film/TV/streaming services industries.
